# You must set some working options before the "spawn-fcgi" service will work.
# If SOCKET points to a file, then this file is cleaned up by the init script.

# See spawn-fcgi(1) for all possible options.

# Example :
FCGI_SOCKET=/var/run/spawn-fcgi-php.sock
FCGI_USER=apache
FCGI_GROUP=apache
FCGI_EXTRA_OPTIONS="-M 0600"
