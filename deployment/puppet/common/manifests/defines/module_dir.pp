# A module_dir is a storage place for all the stuff a module might want to
# store. According to the FHS, this should go to /var/lib. Since this is a part
# of puppet, the full path is /var/lib/puppet/modules/${name}. Every module
# should # prefix its module_dirs with its name.
# 
# By default, the module_dir is loaded from "puppet:///${name}/module_dir". If
# that doesn't exist an empty directory is taken as source. The directory is
# purged so that modules do not have to worry about removing cruft.
# 
# Usage:
#  module_dir { ["common", "common/dir1", "common/dir2" ]: }
