# Changelog:
# 2007-08-26: micah <micah@riseup.net> reported, that lsb_release can report
#  nonsensical values for lsbdistcodename; assert_lsbdistcodename now
#  recognises "n/a" and acts accordingly

# This lightweight class only asserts that $lsbdistcodename is set.
# If the assertion fails, an error is printed on the server
# 
# To fail individual resources on a missing lsbdistcodename, require
# Exec[assert_lsbdistcodename] on the specific resource
#
# This is just one example of how you could avoid evaluation of parts of the
# manifest, before a bootstrapping class has enabled all the necessary goodies.
