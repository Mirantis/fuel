    @doc = "Type for manipulating corosync/pacemaker configuration properties.
      Besides the configuration file that is managed by the module the contains
      all these related Corosync types and providers, there is a set of cluster
      properties that can be set and saved inside the CIB (A CIB being a set of
      configuration that is synced across the cluster, it can be exported as XML
      for processing and backup).  The type is pretty simple interface for
      setting key/value pairs or removing them completely.  Removing them will
      result in them taking on their default value.

      More information on cluster properties can be found here:

      * http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Pacemaker_Explained/_cluster_options.html

      P.S Looked at generating a type dynamically from the cluster's property
      meta-data that would result in a single type with puppet type properties
      of every cluster property...may still do so in a later iteration."

            This paramater sets the CIB this order should be created in. A
