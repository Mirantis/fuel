      are probably the most important building block when creating highly
      available clusters using Corosync and Pacemaker.  Each primitive defines
      an application, ip address, or similar to monitor and maintain.  These
      managed primitives are maintained using what is called a resource agent.
      These resource agents have a concept of class, type, and subsystem that
      provides the functionality.  Regretibly these pieces of vocabulary
      clash with those used in Puppet so to overcome the name clashing the
      property and parameter names have been qualified a bit for clarity.

      More information on primitive definitions can be found at the following
      link:

      * http://www.clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html/Clusters_from_Scratch/_adding_a_resource.html"

        and stop a particular application.  Ocf of the other hand is a script with
