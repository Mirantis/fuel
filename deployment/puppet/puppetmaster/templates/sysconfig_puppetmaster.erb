# You may specify an alternate port or an array of ports on which
# puppetmaster should listen. Default is: 8140
# If you specify more than one port, the puppetmaster ist automatically
# started with the servertype set to mongrel. This might be interesting
# if you'd like to run your puppetmaster in a loadbalanced cluster.
# Please note: this won't setup nor start any loadbalancer.
# If you'd like to run puppetmaster with mongrel as servertype but only
# on one (specified) port, you have to add --servertype=mongrel to
# PUPPETMASTER_EXTRA_OPTS.
# Default: Empty (Puppetmaster isn't started with mongrel, nor on a
# specific port)
#
# Please note: Due to reduced options in the rc-functions lib in RHEL/Centos
# versions prior to 5, this feature won't work. Fedora versions >= 8 are
# known to work.
