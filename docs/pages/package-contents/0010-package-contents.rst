OpenStack is a very versatile and flexible cloud management platform. By exposing its portfolio of cloud infrastructure services – compute, storage, networking and other core resources — through ReST APIs, it enables a wide range of control over these services, from the perspective of both integrated Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) controlled by applications and automated manipulation of the infrastructure itself.

This architectural flexibility doesn’t set itself up magically, however. It asks you, the user and cloud administrator, to organize and manage a large array of configuration options. Consequently, getting the most out of your OpenStack cloud over time – in terms of flexibility, scalability, and manageability – requires a thoughtful combination of automation and configuration choices.

Mirantis Fuel for OpenStack was created to solve exactly this problem. This step-by-step guide takes you through the process of:

* Configuring OpenStack and its supporting components into a robust cloud architecture
* Deploying that architecture through an effective, well-integrated automation package that sets up and maintains the components and their configurations
* Providing access to a well-integrated, up-to-date set of components known to work together
