**Deployment Improvements**
 
* Deployment of Cinder as a standalone node / User choice

  Previously, Cinder could only be deployed onto a compute node.  Now, you may choose to deploy Cinder as a standalone node separate from a compute node.  Both options – either deployed with a compute node or standalone – are available.
