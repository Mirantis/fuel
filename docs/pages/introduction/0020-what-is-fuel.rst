What is Fuel?
-----------------
Fuel is a ready-to-install collection of all of the packages and
scripts you need to create a robust, configurable, vendor-independant
OpenStack cloud in your own environment.

A single OpenStack cloud consists of packages from many different open
source projects, each with its own requirements, installation
procedures, and configuration management. Fuel brings all of these
projects together into a single open source distribution, with
components that have been tested and are guaranteed to work together,
all wrapped up using scripts to help you to work through a single
installation rather than multiple smaller installations.

Simply put, Fuel is a way for you to easily configure and install an
OpenStack-based infrastructure in your own environment.
