Download Fuel
-------------

The first step in installing Fuel is to download the version
appropriate for your environment.

Fuel is available for Essex, Folsom and Grizzly OpenStack installations, and will be available for Havana shortly after Havana's release.

To make your installation easier, we also offer a pre-built ISO for installing the master node with Puppet Master and Cobbler. You can mount this ISO in a physical or VirtualBox machine in order to
easily create your master node. (Instructions for performing this step
without the ISO are given in :ref:`Appendix A <Create-PM>`.)

The master node ISO, along with other Fuel releases, is available in the `Downloads <http://fuel.mirantis.com/your-downloads/>`_ section of the Fuel portal.
