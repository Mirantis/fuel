Preparing for node deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At this point you're almost ready to let Fuel work its magic.
Copy the contents of ``<FUEL_DIR>/deployment/puppet/astute`` to the
``/root`` directory, then change to the ``/root`` directory.

At this point, you've performed the configuration actions normally
handled by the Fuel ISO.  To continue installation, proceed to 
:ref:`Installing the OS using Fuel <Install-OS-Using-Fuel>`.
